                        <p>Menstruation (also termed period or bleeding) is the process of a woman discharging (through
                            the vagina) blood and other materials from the lining of the uterus at about one monthly
                            interval from puberty until menopause (ceasing of regular menstrual cycles), except during
                            pregnancy.  This discharging process lasts about 3-5 days. It is advisable to use a pad for
                            8 hours which means 4 pads are needed in a day and 12-20 pads are needed for a cycle. <br>
                            It is inconveniencing for some Girls and Women that they require medication, oftentimes
                            because they have little knowledge of Menstrual Hygiene Management. <br>
                            Menstrual hygiene management is described as the process whereby “women and adolescent girls
                            use a clean menstrual hygiene management (MHM) material to absorb or collect blood that can
                            be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of the menstruation period,
                            using soap and water for washing their bodies as required and having access to facilities to
                            dispose of used menstrual management material” (UNICEF, WHO 2014). <br>
                            Not having access to menstrual management products and little knowledge on mensuration keeps
                            women from participating in socio‐economic activities when on their periods, resulting in a
                            loss of economic activity in their communities as well as the disenfranchisement of the
                            women. Additionally, women often resort to alternatives such as mattress stuffing, leaves,
                            cloth, rags and even mud etc., which are neither hygienic nor practical of which, these
                            things can cause reproductive tract infections. <br>
                            Girls and Women in these rural areas lack proper knowledge on handling menstruation due to
                            lack of knowledge on sanitary products to use, do not have access to the conventional
                            sanitary products, lack of water and method of disposal. Our goal is to educate these
                            communities on methods of disposal, to engage and educate them on climate change, how to
                            prevent climate hazards through proper sanitary disposal and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
                            (WASH). <br>
                            According to UNICEF, 1 in 10 girls in Sub‐Saharan Africa will miss school due to menstrual
                            related issues. This has major ramifications on the likelihood of girls staying in
                            education, which in turn has knock‐on effects on all aspects of girls’ lives. <br>
                            The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in its 2015 study in three Nigerian
                            states — Katsina, Anambra and Osun — revealed that menstruating school girls face great
                            discomfort during their menstrual period. They often experience anxiety, abdominal pain and
                            cramps, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and a loss of appetite. As a result, many of the
                            girls miss classes and even when they manage to attend, they are distracted. <br>
                            In Nigeria where education is almost for free, 75% of the girls miss school during their
                            monthly period; on average, they miss five days of school a month — about six weeks of
                            learning in a session. Furthermore, research ﬁnding showed that girls' capacity to manage
                            their periods is aﬀected by lack of access to aﬀordable hygienic sanitary materials disposal
                            options for used materials, adequate water supply, clean toilets, hand washing facilities
                            and access to changing rooms.  If these facilities are not always available in school, it
                            exposes many girls to manage their periods with great discomfort and in unhygienic
                            conditions. (Olukanni, 2013). 
                            With research, reusable pads are said to be hygienic and economical. The reusable pads
                            consist of two parts: a holder and a pad. The holder is made from durable tetron material,
                            inside of which there is water proof bambino. A pad is made from cotton fabric with 2 layers
                            of towel inside. Every pack consists of two holders and three pads, which will then be secured
                            by a ribbon on two sides of the holder.<br>
                            The product has been tested by several women and they were very satisfied with its quality.
                            According to these test results, the cotton feels soft and the pad is easy to use and also
                            to wash.  </p>

                        <p>The communities we are looking at are rural communities in Nigeria, with thousands of families, these villagers are mostly farmers and owners of petty stores whose income cannot feed their family let alone buy commercial disposable sanitary pads. From findings there are usually leakage from poor-quality protection materials and vaginal infections; inadequate waste disposal facilities, Absenteeism where girls stay at home rather than attend school when menstruating, Unhygienic ways to dry menstrual materials, Limited education about the facts of menstruation; Limited access to counseling and guidance; The lack of resources for washing such as soap and the unsupportive attitudes of some men. 
                            Therefore, the communities of these villages highly require support with MHM and WASH practice lecture and on the usage of Eco Reusable Pads.</p>

                        <p>Female students and women face great challenges in terms of hygiene and sanitation. For
                            females who are menstruating, these problems compound the difficulties posed by the
                            inability to afford sanitary towels as well as cultural taboos around menstruation. <br>
                            Some local communities’ elders and women have requested participation from us to take the
                            task of supporting Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) and Water, Sanitation and hygiene
                            education (WASH) with health practitioners through development programs and follow up.</p>
